     I have got to teach you about food. Close your eyes. It's the father fucking God! Fuck me, God! Man you... We've already noticed something. Another man... Ah! And you want it? What if you die? You're gonna be stopped drinking. Uh huh. When we move in similar detect, Tony Plates, it's a fine line between criticism and trying to hate. I come on 25, 8, I never have an 8. Don't fall in cause loose ends, I can solidate. I can solidate, yo, I can solidate. Playing with the men here, killers at this convoy late. We'll got to commentate. So I commentate. Care less about the chat rooms, I don't mind a break. Don't be up in the back room with the accommodate. No God calls the top, boom, that's how we dominate. One thing that shows us all, we not similar. I keep flip my shit on stage and break the fibrillars. It's terrible to let go of a gage. Files with dickless captured to burn the curb and learn to waste it in meticulous. They fibrillars, huh? I think they need stimulus. Gotta keep your head in the game and shit, minimalist. This is Chris Smalls, who I've been science on, Lazy Graham. I see pitfalls in your minds, you and your guys, Dickey Plank, what you fancy plans? Let me take the flies, Bikki's whimp. I'm a picky man, I don't wanna talk about no specifics. I'm black, domestic, what Smith and Wesson is, Nah, I'm business. God's the sister, blowing on the biscuit. Found my switch. Ligger, my horse, kick it, they just dishing out. Delicious. Shit's flowing, it's libation. Out the picture, consider this whole real obligation out of the picture. You get your shit so, we're not familiar, lockin' position. Listen, we get low, we not revealing our positions. Look at the info, Google my name. I'm boss of business, it's duck season. Niggas, greeners, go shit, I do shit. I've been in Italy to let the leaders see the boot kick. You see it, ten of me if you believe you're seeing no shit. I do kick, so are you, can nick a arm of doosin'? I put the stock inside the sauce pot and got the future. I hit the bone inside the corner pocket, hallelujah. Hallelujah, pockets fully blown like rock and fellah. With no trace of eggs, we bounced back like brothers. Niggas getting sauce, money like jigg or primo and jazz, oh. Bass grow, I seen that shit start as a temple. Niggas vicious cut and switches. You the blast don't wanna worry, mission cuz you're the u-jutsin' asshole. Drop the shit like it sits you if you know you know you're too efficient. I'm not gonna be carrying niggas, shit, civil whipped and chomerral like an yellow, when he stepped up the billboard. I'm always on a plane, I cannot beat his foot. I see the holes in niggas game like the US soldier. Got juice like the Beatles, nigga I'm John, when they got the jeweler throwing stones at my chain. Like it's sinning, rapids just aquafish old men attacking what they is. And if you niggas dope, you get subtracted by the grand. I found a white move, this been like kill a camp. This slam on niggas like it was NBA, James Demand got eliminated for tripping like Dan. The clips was elongated like Pippas Wingspan. Put us in a game and you can feel the impact. Even stars get struck like Eminem fans. You get your whole set, you niggas like public house in your counseling. From here now we keep em' bouncing, from now on in this sophisticated like your house plan. You
